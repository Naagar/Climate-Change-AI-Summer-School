# Overview
---

This notebook will present the underlying background of CityLearn and its relevance to climate change mitigation. We provide a walk-through tutorial on how to set up and interact with the simulation environment using a real-world dataset from a grid-interactive residential community in Fontana, California.

The notebook will provide a guide on how to design a simple rule-based control alogorithm and advanced reinforcement control algorithms to manage batteries in each home in the community with a goal of minimizing the cost of purchased electricity, carbon emissions associated with consuming electricity from the grid, as well as improve on other grid-level KPIs e.g. peak demand, load factor and ramping that are critical for the long-term sustainability of decarbonizing existing power generation sources on the supply side and electrification of buildings on the demand side.

## Contributions

The primary contribution of this tutorial is to introduce the software tool, CityLearn, to model and benchmark simple and advanced control strategies in grid-interactive smart communities, e.g., demand response and load shaping in buildings. The secondary contribution is to bring awareness to datasets for building controls research that are provided within the CityLearn environment.

## Learning Outcomes

# Climate Impact
---

The residential building stock in the United States is responsible for 21% ([Energy Information Administration, 2022](https://www.eia.gov/totalenergy/data/monthly/archive/00352211.pdf)) of energy consumption and 20% of greenhouse gas emissions ([Goldenstein et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1922205117)). Electrification of end-uses as well as decarbonizing the electrical grid through renewable energy sources such as solar and wind, constitutes a pathway to zero-emission buildings ([Leibowicz et al., 2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.09.046)). However, electrifying fossil-fueled building end-uses in fact could increase the demand on the existing electricity power grid and if power generation sources are not decarbonized at a similar rate as electrification happening on the demand side, could result in adverse effects of increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Also, new grid infrastructure constitutes a significant capital investment and requires extensive planning and execution.

Through distributed energy resources (DERs), buildings can provide flexibility services to the existing grid infrastructure in demand response events. On-site solar photovoltaic (PV) systems can also reduce dependence on the grid through self-generation. Yet, the intermittency of renewable energy sources introduces additional challenges of grid instability due to the mismatch between electricity generation (supply) and demand ([Suberu et al., 2014](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2014.04.009)). The California duck-curve is a good illustration of the mismatch in renewable supply and demand, and shows the effect of increased PV penetration that may lead to higher ramp rate during sunset which the electric power grid may not be able to handle ([Denholm et al., 2008](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy08osti/42305.pdf)).

</figure>

Advanced control algorithms including model-predictive control (MPC) and reinforcement learning control (RLC) are thus, critical to properly manage DERs and even out the supply-demand imbalance brought about by renewable energy sources. However, a major challenge for the adoption of reinforcement learning (RL) in grid-interactive efficient buildings (GEBs) is the ability to benchmark control algorithm performance that accelerates their deployment on live systems.

CityLearn ([Vazquez-Canteli et al., 2019](https://doi.org/10.1145/3360322.3360998)) provides a platform for such benchmarking tasks. The different stakeholder in the energy and real-estate market including, utility companies, grid-operators, home-owners and policy makers can utilize CityLearn to make decisions on what control policies are viable and provide the best performance as more controllable DERs become available.

## Grid-Interactive Efficient Buildings and their Energy Flexibility

As buildings become electrified and the penetration of renewable energy source increases, a smart approach to managing and controlling building loads to ensure that these developments do not bring about grid insecurity is needed. The Department of Energy (DOE), introduced the __Grid-Interactive Efficient Building (GEB)__ Initiative to promote the integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) such as photovoltaic (PV) systems, electric vehicles (EVs), active energy storage systems e.g. batteries, thermal energy storage systems, and passive energy storage systems e.g. thermal mass (walls) in buildings that can provide the grid with energy flexibility. A GEB is defined by [Neukomm et al.](https://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/pdfs/75470.pdf) as:

> [...] an energy-efficient building that uses smart technologies and on-site DERs to provide demand flexibility while co-optimizing for energy cost, grid services, and occupant needs and preferences, in a continuous and integrated way.

GEBs are characterized by their energy efficiency, interconnectivity, smartness and energy flexibility as depicted in the figure below:

<figure class="image">
  <img src="https://github.com/intelligent-environments-lab/CityLearn/blob/master/assets/images/grid_interactive_building-neukomm.png?raw=true"  width="600" alt="The characteristics of a Grid-Interactive Efficient Building (GEB)">
  <figcaption>Figure: The characteristics of a Grid-Interactive Efficient Building (GEB) (<a href="https://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/pdfs/75470.pdf">Neukomm et al., 2019</a>).</figcaption>
</figure>

The energy efficiency of GEBs by means of tighter envelopes and high-quality construction that minimize heat losses lead to reduced loads without the need to make changes to a building's function or occupant preferences. PV adoption in GEBs provides self-generation capabilities, which reduce the net load (difference between building end-use load and renewable energy generation) that will otherwise be satisfied by the electric grid alone. To then solve the duck curve problem that is introduced by renewable power generation, GEBs are able to shed and/or shift their loads. In load shedding, GEBs reduce their electricity use for a short time period and typically on short notice during peak demand periods. Load shifting in GEBs entails intentional and planned change in the timing of electricity use to reduce the demand on the grid during typical peak periods. Load shifting helps take advantage of cheaper and cleaner electricity. Load shedding may result in shifting the shedded load.

The figure below shows the changes in a building profile as it becomes more efficient, incorporates self generation and provides load shedding and shifting grid services.

<figure class="image">
  <img src="https://github.com/intelligent-environments-lab/CityLearn/blob/master/assets/images/grid_interactive_building_profile-neukomm.png?raw=true"  width="600" alt="GEB load profiles">
  <figcaption>Figure: GEB load profiles (<a href="https://www1.eere.energy.gov/buildings/pdfs/75470.pdf">Neukomm et al., 2019</a>).</figcaption>
</figure>

Particularly, load shifting services could be achieved through control of active storage systems in combination with renewable power generation. Smart controls can adapt to changes in occupant behavior, weather conditions or respond to external signals e.g. temperature set-point as in the case of demand-response, while maintaining energy efficiency and without causing discomfort to occupants. This adaptability is often referred to as __energy flexibility__ of a building ([Jensen et al., 2017](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.08.044)).

## Control Approaches for Grid-Interactive Efficient Buildings
Rule-based control (RBC) is a popular control approach for building energy management. It makes use of simple if-else statements in their decision making process e.g. "if outdoor dry-bulb temperature is < 20<sup>o</sup>C and hour is 10 PM, charge battery by 5% of its capacity". Advanced control systems such as model predictive control (MPC) ([Drgona et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.arcontrol.2020.09.001)) and reinforcement learning control (RLC) ([Wang et al., 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2020.115036)) can be a major driver for executing grid services by automating the operation of energy systems, while adapting to individual characteristics of occupants and buildings. Comparatively, RBC and RLC are inexpensive to implement as they have a lower entry bar for domain knowledge of the systems to be controlled. RBC and vanilla RLC may perform sub-optimally compared to MPC as they do not require a model of the building's thermal dynamics to be developed a priori although there exists model-based RLC that includes said model. RLC is a data-driven solution and as more training data become available, it _learns_ the building model and achieves comparable performance as MPC. The greatest strength of RLC is its ability to adapt to changes in the building it controls as its dynamics e.g. thermal, occupancy change. We provide more context on reinforcement learning in the following section.

## Reinforcement Learning Control for Grid-Interactive Efficient Buildings

Here we provide a simple description of reinforcement learning (RL) in the context of grid-interactive efficient buildings (GEBs) with as little theoretical jargon as possible 🙂. For a more detailed introduction to RL for building energy management, refer to ([Nagy et al., 2023](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.buildenv.2023.110435)).

<figure class="image">
  <img src="https://github.com/intelligent-environments-lab/CityLearn/blob/master/assets/images/supervised_vs_unsupervised_vs_rl.png?raw=true"  width="250" alt="Overview of the three machine learning techniques.">
  <figcaption>Figure: Overview of the three machine learning techniques (<a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781315142074-37/reinforcement-learning-intelligent-environments-zoltan-nagy-june-young-park-josé-ramón-vázquez-canteli">Nagy et al., 2018</a>).</figcaption>
</figure>

Machine learning techniques are generally characterized as either supervised or unsupervised learning. In supervised learning, the observations, otherwise called samples, and their response, otherwise called target are known when training the model. Supervised learning is further classified into regression and classification models where the former learns to predict a continuous variable and the latter learns to predict a discrete class. The supervised machine learning model must then learn the mapping of samples to targets by minimizing a loss function that evaluates the error between predicted targets and actual targets. An example of regression modelling in the context of GEBs is the prediction of a building's electricity consumption (target) when the the weather conditions e.g. dry-bulb temperature and relative humidity, as well as their associated timestamps (samples) are known. An example of a classification model in the context of GEBs is the prediction of a binary variable such as if building is "occupied" or "unoccupied" (target) given the same samples as the regression example. It so happens that these kinds of problems are common in the building energy domain where predicting a building's electricity consumption and occupancy can help with scheduling and occupant-centric control to balance energy efficiency and comfort.

Unsupervised learning on the other hand differs from supervised learning in the sense that the associated targets for the samples are unknown but models can be used to find common patterns amongst samples. This is important especially in exploratory data analysis to draw preliminary conclusions about a new dataset, and in situations where the class labels are unknown. An unsupervised model can then be used to infer data-driven class labels that can be used as targets in supervised classification models. An example of such application in buildings is the clustering of customer load profiles to determine and allocate appropriate tariff plans.

RL is similar to both supervised and unsupervised learning such that it follows the same idea of learning from observations. However in contrast to supervised learning, there are no known labeled targets. Instead, a model (agent/controller) influences the targets by acting in an environment that rewards actions that have desirable outcomes but penalizes those that lead to adverse outcomes. An example of RL in GEBs is charging/discharging of a battery (action) every hour (control time step) with the objective of minimizing the cost of electricity consumption of a building over a control horizon e.g. a year, given the same sample variables in the supervised learning example (observations). These actions affect the hourly electricity consumption cost (reward). RL is thought of as a trial an error approach because typically, the agent starts off with no prior knowledge of the environment it acts in but learns from experience to associate observations with actions that maximize its cummulative reward. This association is called a control policy.

<figure class="image">
  <img src="https://github.com/intelligent-environments-lab/CityLearn/blob/master/assets/images/reinforcement_learning.png?raw=true"  width="400" alt="Basic structure of reinforcement learning.">
  <figcaption>Figure: Basic structure of reinforcement learning (<a href="https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781315142074-37/reinforcement-learning-intelligent-environments-zoltan-nagy-june-young-park-josé-ramón-vázquez-canteli">Nagy et al., 2018</a>).</figcaption>
</figure>

The experiential learning characteristic of RL is very promising for GEBs because it provides a scalable control solution that adapts to each building's unique conditions and occupant interactions that influence observations. It also means that the agent need not have a building's model that can involve a level of complexity that is expensive to design for. [Vazquez-Canteli et al.](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2018.11.002) provide a comprehensive overview of how reinforcement learning has been used in the built environment.

## CityLearn

CityLearn ([Nweye et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2405.03848)) is an open-source Gymnasium environment for the easy implementation and benchmarking of rule-based control (RBC), reinforcement learning control (RLC), and model-predictive control (MPC) algorithms for distributed energy resources (DERs) in a demand response (DR) setting. CityLearn is used to reshape the aggregated electricity load profile by controlling DERs in a district of diverse
buildings, and allows for multi-agent control and district-level key performance indicators (KPIs) evaluation. First developed by [Vazquez-Canteli et al.](https://doi.org/10.1145/3360322.3360998), it has been [applied
extensively for DER control benchmarking in scenarios of
DR ,voltage regulation as well as control policy meta-learning, and transfer
learning](https://www.citylearn.net/index.html#applications).

CityLearn is used in [The CityLearn Challenge](https://www.citylearn.net/citylearn_challenge/index.html) which is an opportunity to compete in investigating the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and distributed control systems to tackle multiple problems in the built-environment. It attracts a multidisciplinary audience including researchers, industry experts, sustainability enthusiasts and AI hobbyists as a means of crowd-sourcing solutions to these multiple problems.

### Environment

<figure class="image">
  <img src="https://github.com/intelligent-environments-lab/CityLearn/blob/master/assets/images/environment.jpg?raw=true"  width="800" alt="An overview of the heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems, energy storage systems, on-site electricity sources and grid interaction in buildings in the CityLearn environment." style="background-color:white;margin:20px;padding:5px">
  <figcaption>Figure: CityLearn building model including electricity sources that power controllable DERs including electric devices and ESSs, used to satisfy thermal and electrical loads as well as provide the grid with energy flexibility. A distinction is made between environment and control aspects of a building to show the transfer of actions from the control agent and reception of measurable observations by the control agent that quantifies the building's states (<a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2405.03848">Nweye et al., 2024</a>).</figcaption>
</figure>

CityLearn models a district of buildings with similar or different loads, electric devices, energy storage systems (ESSs) and electricity sources that satisfy the loads as shown in the figure above. There is no upper limit on the number of buildings in a district and a district can have as few as one building.

There are up to five loads in a building including space cooling, space heating domestic hot water (DHW) heating, electric equipment, and electric (EV) loads. The space cooling and heating loads refer to the energy needed to maintain the indoor
dry-bulb temperature at its setpoint. A building in CityLearn is modeled as a single thermal zone where space thermal loads affect its indoor dry-bulb temperature. It uses an long-short-term memory regression model to approximate its thermal dynamics that quantifies the effect of the thermal load on temperature. Then, an occupant model has the ability to override the temperature setpoint. The DHW heating load is the total heating energy needed to satisfy hot water end-uses such as shower, bathroom, and kitchen sinks, and other water end uses requiring water heating that are not space heating-related. Electric equipment refer to non-shiftable plug loads such as lighting, entertainment and kitchen appliances. The EV load is the energy required to charge an EV to a scheduled departure state-of-charge (SoC).

Not all loads need to exist in a building e.g., a building situated in a heating dominant climate may not have cooling loads year-round. Also, anyone or all of these loads are either known a priori from building energy performance
simulation (BEPS) or real-world measurement. In these instances, the ideal load must be satisfied. Alternatively, they are controlled loads and are inferred at runtime e.g., heat pump power control drives space cooling or heating loads.

To satisfy these loads in either the ideal or control-action case, CityLearn makes use of heating ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems directly or ESSs through load shifting. The `cooling_device`, `heating_device`, and `dhw_device` are HVAC electric device objects in CityLearn that are used to satisfy the space cooling, space heating and DHW heating loads respectively. The `cooling_device` is a heat pump while the `heating_device` and `dhw_device` are either heat pump or electric heater type. These HVAC systems may be used to charge thermal energy storage (TES) systems in the building.

There are up to five optional and controlled ESSs in a building including `cooling_storage`, `heating_storage`, `dhw_storage`, `electrical_storage`, and `electric_vehicle` ESS objects. The `cooling_storage`, `heating_storage`, and `dhw_storage` are thermal energy storage (TES) DER type and provide space cooling, space heating and DHW heating load shifting flexibility respectively. They are charged by the HVAC device used to meet the thermal load which they service e.g. is the cooling_device charging the `cooling_storage`. The `electrical_storage` is a battery energy storage system (BESS) DER type that powers any of the aforementioned electric devices when in discharge mode or is powered by one or more of the electricity sources. The `electric_vehicle` is an EV DER type and performs similar function as the `electrical_storage`, however, the EV is available on a schedule defined by its arrival and departure
times. The EV can be used in three modes: grid-to-vehicle (G2V), vehicle-to-grid (V2G), and no control (i.e., where the EV acts as a load without any possible control over its charging).

The electric devices are primarily powered by the electric grid. CityLearn at the time of writing, does not include a grid model so the power a building is able to draw from the grid at a given time step is unconstrained, except in the
case of a power outage. Optionally, a building may have a photovoltaic (PV) system that provides self-generation as a first source of electricity before the grid. The optional `electrical_storage` and `electric_vehicle` are charged by the grid and PV but also augment the electricity supply when in discharge mode to supply the building with electricity. Excess self-generation, `electrical_storage`, and `electric_vehicle` discharge are sent to the grid as part of the building's net export.

The CityLearn environment makes use of the Farama Foundation Gymnasium interface for standardized RLC environment design, where there is an observation-action-reward exchange loop between the environment and control agent as the environment transitions from one time step to another. In the current time step, $t$, the control agent receives the environment's observations, $o_t$ and prescribes actions $a_t$. The actions are applied to the environment to affect the observations at the next time step, $o_{t + 1}$. $o_{t + 1}$ and a reward, $r_{t + 1}$ (from reward function, $R$) that quantifies the quality of $a_t$ in optimizing the outcome of a control objective or KPI are returned to the control agent to teach it to learn a control policy, $\pi$. $\pi$ maps actions to observations that maximize the
cumulative reward over an episode i.e., the terminal state of the environment, after initialization ($t = 0$), beyond which there are new observations.

  <figcaption>Figure: Single-agent (left), independent multi-agent (middle), and coordinated multi-agent (right) control configurations (<a href="https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2405.03848">Nweye et al., 2024</a>).</figcaption>
</figure>

There are three possible control configurations in CityLearn namely; single-agent, independent multi-agent, and coordinated multi-agent as shown in the figure above. In the single-agent configuration, there is a one-to-many relationship between the control agent and buildings where a centralized agent collects observations and prescribes actions for all DERs in the district and, receives a single reward value each time step to learn a generalized control policy. This is akin to an energy aggregator controlling flexible resources in a distributed manner. The independent multi-agent configuration has a one-to-one agent-building relationship thus, there are as many rewards as buildings each time step and a unique control policy is learned for each building. The coordinated multi-agent configuration is similar to the independent multi-agent configuration except that agents can share information to achieve cooperative objectives e.g. district peak reduction or competitive objectives e.g. price bidding in the energy flexibility market.

We emphasize that CityLearn is not limited to RLC algorithms alone despite its Gymnasium interface as it works with other simple control theory algorithms e.g., RBC as well as advanced control theory algorithms e.g., MPC. In RBC, the reward is not utilized while in MPC, the reward is akin to the control objective. Also, RBC policy is static and does not consider the observations
in the following time step to update its rules.

### Datasets

The CityLearn environment makes use of [datasets](https://www.citylearn.net/overview/dataset.html#dataset) to define the simulation environment as well as provide the control agent with observations.

Each dataset is a unique environment configuration where environments differ by their location and climate zone that influence their weather file and building characteristics, time series date range, building count, model availability (thermal, occupant and power outage models) that affect the complexity of the control problem, control signal availability including electricity pricing and carbon emissions time series, building loads, controllable ESSs, and PV system availability for self-generation.

# Hands-On Experiments and Exercises

<img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/KPn24x701Asus/giphy.gif" height=200></img>

The previous sections have motivated the purpose of this tutorial as well as provided background information on reinforcement learning control (RLC) and the CityLearn environment while highlighting the importance in harnessing energy flexibility in grid-interactive efficient buildings (GEBs). The following sections will be hands-on as we will go over the experiments and exercises that this tutorial covers.

Using the `citylearn_challenge_2022_phase_all` dataset, we will __learn how to__ design a controller for battery management in a two-building environment for load shifting flexibility where each building also has a photovoltaic (PV) system for self-generation. This way, the battery-PV system provides flexibility to the grid.

We will implement five control approaches namely:
1. Baseline control
2. Random control
3. Rule-based control (RBC)
4. Tabular Q-Learning (TQL)
5. Soft-Actor Critic (SAC)

The baseline control is the use-case where there is no energy flexibility provided by the battery and only the PV is used for self-generation. The random control includes the batteries in the buildings however, the control agent takes arbitrarily random actions to control the battery. Both the baseline and random control approaches serve as our reference cases where the baseline control is used to make a case for using batteries to shift loads while the random control is used to make a case for applying some logic to how we control the batteries.

Rule-based control is a simple control theory where rules or statements that are usually in the form of `if X do Y else do Z...` are used to prescribe an appropriate control action at a given point in time. Tabular Q-Learning and SAC are both reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms where the difference between the two is that while in Tabular Q-Learning, Q-values are updated through exhaustive exploration and exploitation of the environment, SAC uses a function approximator to estimate the Q-values to accelerate learning. More information about Tabular Q-Learning, Q-values and SAC will be provided in the following sections so do no worry if they are not familiar terms _yet_ 🙂. By using these latter three control algorithms, we will highlight some of their strengths and weaknesses.

We will evaluate all five control approaches using a set of key performance indicators (KPIs).

# Dataset Description
---

The `citylearn_challenge_2022_phase_all` dataset used in this tutorial is from [17 zero net energy (ZNE) single-family homes in the Sierra Crest Zero Net Energy community in Fontana, California](https://www.calmac.org/publications/CSIRDD_Sol4_EPRI_Grid-Integration-of-ZNE-Communities_FinalRpt_2017-01-27.pdf), which is pictured below. The buildings were studied for grid integration of zero net energy communities as part of the California Solar Initiative program specifically exploring the [impact of high penetration PV generation and on-site electricity storage](https://www.aceee.org/files/proceedings/2016/data/papers/10_1237.pdf). This dataset is the same as that used in [The CityLearn Challenge 2022](https://www.aicrowd.com/challenges/neurips-2022-citylearn-challenge) and represents a one-year period between August 1, 2016 and July 31, 2017.

  <figcaption>Figure: Building elevations in Sierra Crest Zero Net Energy community in Fontana, California.</figcaption>
</figure>

Each building in the dataset is a single-family archetype that was constructed in the mid to late 2010s and has a gross floor area between 177 m<sup>2</sup> and 269 m<sup>2</sup>. The figure below shows the envelope and system characteristics of the buildings. The building envelope is made from high-performance materials for improved insulation and the buildings are equipped with high-efficiency appliances, electric heating and water heating systems. Each building also has a home energy management system as well as circuit-level monitoring that provides one-minute power time series data.

  <img src="https://github.com/intelligent-environments-lab/CityLearn/blob/master/assets/images/fontana_building_systems.png?raw=true"  width="400" alt="Building elevations in Sierra Crest Zero Net Energy community in Fontana, California.">
  <figcaption>Figure: Building systems in Sierra Crest Zero Net Energy community in Fontana, California.</figcaption>
</figure>

In the as-built community, eight of the 17 buildings are equipped with 6.4 kWh capacity batteries that have 5 kW power rating, 90\% round-trip efficiency, and 75\% depth-of-discharge. The installed PV capacity is 4 kW or 5 kW for homes with or without batteries, respectively.

The `citylearn_challenge_2022_phase_all` dataset is a transformed version of the as-built buildings and original circuit-level data that were provided by Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), whom were stakeholders in the Sierra Crest Zero Net Energy community and a sponsor in The CityLearn Challenge 2022. This transformed version fixed data quality issues and addressed privacy concerns towards making the dataset open-source. The transformed dataset has the following modifications:

1. The power time series has been transformed to hourly energy data in kWh.
2. Data quality issues such as outliers and gaps were addressed using inter-quartile range (IQR) outlier detection, interpolation and supervised learning prediction modeling.
3. All buildings have 6.4 kWh capacity batteries with 5 kW power rating, and 90% round-trip efficiency. The depth-of-discharge is 100%.
4. Space cooling, space heating, domestic water heating and plug loads have been coupled together under non-shiftable loads by directly using the main meter.

The following projects have made use of this transformed dataset:
1. [MERLIN: Multi-agent offline and transfer learning for occupant-centric energy flexible operation of grid-interactive communities using smart meter data and CityLearn](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2301.01148)

## Loading the Dataset

The dataset is included in the CityLearn package installation which we will now read into memory. To read the dataset, all we need is the name that references it:

"""## Data Preprocessing

Now that we are familiar with the CityLearn `citylearn_challenge_2022_phase_all` dataset, we will assign some constants that make minor changes to its schema that will improve our learning experience in this tutorial. These changes are as follows:

1. We want to use a subset of the buildings so that we are not overwhelmed by the amount of data to analyze during the tutorial 🙂. Since CityLearn is primarily designed for district level energy management and coordination we should use more than one building, although a one-building environment is possible. A considerable building count for tutoring purposes is two to three.
2. We want to use only a one-week period from the entire one-year period for this tutorial for the same reason of ease of analysis.
3. Instead of using the [full observation space](https://www.citylearn.net/overview/observations.html) that will take a while to explore and converge in RL implementations, we will narrow down the space to only one observation: `hour`. This is not the best set up because the hour alone does not explain the state transitions in the environment that the agent is observing, nevertheless, it will help highlight the strengths and weaknesses of different control algorithms.
4. CityLearn allows for three control configurations: single-agent, independent multi-agent, and coordinated multi-agent as earlier discussed. In this tutorial we will make use of the single-agent configuration.

To keep things interesting, the buildings and one-week period will be pseudorandomly selected but for reproducibility, we will set the random generator seed. This seed can be changed to any value to select another pseudorandom set of buildings and time period. We will define two functions to help us make these selections:

"""# Key Performance Indicators for Evaluation
---

We evaluate the control agents' performance using five key performance indicators (KPIs) that are to be minimized: electricity cost, carbon emissions, average daily peak, ramping, and (1 - load factor). Average daily peak, ramping and (1 - load factor) are district-level KPIs that are calculated using the aggregated district-level hourly net electricity consumption (kWh), $E_h^{\textrm{district}}$. Electricity cost, and carbon emissions are building-level KPIs that are calculated using the building-level hourly net electricity consumption (kWh), $E_h^{\textrm{building}}$, and are reported at the grid level as the average of the building-level values.

Electricity cost is defined as the sum of building-level imported electricity cost, $E_h^{\textrm{building}} \times T_h$ (\$), where $T_h$ is the electricity rate at hour $h$.

$$
    \textrm{cost} = \sum_{h=0}^{n-1}{\textrm{max} \left (0,E_h^{\textrm{building}} \times T_h \right )}
$$

Carbon emissions is the sum of building-level carbon emissions (kg<sub>CO<sub>2</sub>e</sub>), $E_h^{\textrm{building}} \times O_h$, where $O_h$ is the carbon intensity (kg<sub>CO<sub>2</sub>e</sub>/kWh) at hour $h$.

$$
    \textrm{carbon emissions} = \sum_{h=0}^{n-1}{\textrm{max} \left (0,E_h^{\textrm{building}} \times O_h \right )}
$$

Average daily peak, is defined as the mean of the daily $E_h^{\textrm{district}}$ peak where $d$ is the day index and $n$ is the total number of days.

$$
    \textrm{average daily peak} = \frac{
        {\sum}_{d=0}^{n - 1} {\sum}_{h=0}^{23} {\textrm{max} \left (E_{24d + h}^{\textrm{district}}, \dots, E_{24d + 23}^{\textrm{district}} \right)}
    }{n}
$$

Ramping is defined as the absolute difference of consecutive $E_h^{\textrm{district}}$. It represents the smoothness of the district's load profile where low ramping means there is gradual increase in grid load even after self-generation becomes unavailable in the evening and early morning. High ramping means abrupt change in grid load that may lead to unscheduled strain on grid infrastructure and blackouts as a result of supply deficit.

$$
    \textrm{ramping} = \sum_{h=0}^{n-1}  \lvert E_{h}^{\textrm{district}} - E_{h - 1}^{\textrm{district}} \rvert
$$

Load factor is defined as the average ratio of monthly average and peak $E_{h}^{\textrm{district}}$ where $m$ is the month index, $d$ is the number of days in a month and $n$ is the number of months. Load factor represents the efficiency of electricity consumption and is bounded between 0 (very inefficient) and 1 (highly efficient) thus, the goal is to maximize the load factor or in the same fashion as the other KPIs, minimize (1 - load factor).

$$
    \textrm{1 - load factor}  = \Big(
        \sum_{m=0}^{n - 1} 1 - \frac{
            \left (
                \sum_{h=0}^{d - 1} E_{d \cdot m + h}^{\textrm{district}}
            \right ) \div d
        }{
            \textrm{max} \left (E_{d \cdot m}^{\textrm{district}}, \dots, E_{d \cdot m + d - 1}^{\textrm{district}} \right )
    }\Big) \div n
$$

The KPIs are reported as normalized values with respect to the baseline outcome where the baseline outcome is when buildings are not equipped with batteries i.e., no control. Thus a KPI less than 1.0 is preferred to make a case for including the battery or an advanced control approach.

$$
    \textrm{KPI} = \frac{{\textrm{KPI}_{control}}}{\textrm{KPI}_{baseline (no\ battery)}}
$$

# Convenience Functions to Display Simulation Results

CityLearn itself is able to report the key performance indicators (KPIs) during simulation using the `citylearn.citylearn.CityLearnEnv.evaluate` (see [docs](https://www.citylearn.net/api/citylearn.citylearn.html#citylearn.citylearn.CityLearnEnv.evaluate)) method however, let us go ahead and define some convenience functions to help us parse and visualize the KPIs from CityLearn.

# Experiment 1: Simulate Baseline
---

In this first experiment, you will learn how to set up a CityLearn environment for control, and how to run inference using a baseline control model.

CityLearn includes the `citylearn.agents.base.BaselineAgent` model that steps through the agent without controlling any of the availiable DERs. Thus, it serves as a good reference when quantifying the benefits of the DERs in the environment.

As seen earlier, we begin by initializing the environment:
"""

baseline_env = CityLearnEnv(
    DATASET_NAME,
    central_agent=CENTRAL_AGENT,
    buildings=BUILDINGS,
    active_observations=ACTIVE_OBSERVATIONS,
    simulation_start_time_step=SIMULATION_START_TIME_STEP,
    simulation_end_time_step=SIMULATION_END_TIME_STEP,
)

"""Next, we initialize an instance of `citylearn.agents.base.BaselineAgent`. Initializing the agent only requires that we supply it the just initialized environment:"""

baseline_model = BaselineAgent(baseline_env)

"""Then we run inference on this baseline agent by collecting observations from the environment, selecting actions using the collected observations, and finally applying the actions in one control step. Note that since we are using the baseline agent, there are actually no actions being applied and the `actions` variable you see below is an empty list:"""

# always start by reseting the environment
observations, _ = baseline_env.reset()

# step through the environment until terminal
# state is reached i.e., the control episode ends
while not baseline_env.terminated:
    # select actions from the model
    actions = baseline_model.predict(observations)

    # apply selected actions to the environment
    observations, _, _, _, _ = baseline_env.step(actions)

"""Let us unpack what the code cell above does.

The `reset` function first configures the environment to its initial state, i.e., time step, $t = 0$ then returns the first observations of the environment. This `reset` function is especially important when training RL agents as agents are trained over many episodes and each time a training episode completes, the environment must be returned to its inital state.

We can infer if an episode has completed using the `citylearn.citylearn.CityLearnEnv.terminated` property that returns `True` at the point of completion otherwise, `False`.

The `citylearn.agents.base.BaselineAgent.predict` is a method common th all agents classes in CityLearn that inherits from the [citylearn.agents.base.Agent](https://www.citylearn.net/api/citylearn.agents.base.html#citylearn.agents.base.Agent) class. This base class has 4 methods that are important to note when defining a new class that inherits from it. namely:

1. `__init__` - Used to initialize a new agent with a `citylearn.citylearn.CityLearnEnv` object.
2. `learn`: Used to train the initialized object on its environment object.
3. `predict`: Used to select actions at each simulation timestep using a defined policy that may be rule-based, reinforcement learning-based or model predictive control-based. The base class selects random actions.
4. `update`: Used to update replay buffers, networks and policies at least every timestep. The base class does not perform any updates.
5. `next_time_step`: Used to proceed to the next timestep and is called inside `predict`. This function is where class values or custom values that need to collected or updated are best manipulated.

The `citylearn.citylearn.CityLearnEnv.step` function transitions an environment from one state to another by applying the predicted actions and advancing the environment to its next time step.

Now we understand the inference code cell, we can visualize the baseline agent's KPIs by calling the `plot_simulation_summary` convenience function we defined earlier:
"""

plot_simulation_summary({
    'Baseline': baseline_env,
})

"""The figures above tell us about the KPIs, load and battery SoC profiles for the baseline case.

`Building-level KPIs` figures shows the normalized electricity cost and emissions for the baseline. Notice that for both buildings, the KPIs are equal to 1.0 meaning the agent is no better or worse-off compared to the normalizing KPI. This is expected since we do not control the batteries.

`Building-level simulation period load profiles` figures show the week-long net-electricity consumption profile for each building.

`Building-level daily-average load profiles` shows the daily average net-electricity consumption profile for each building and quickly reveals the hourly difference in the building loads influenced by different occupant behaviors.

`Battery SoC profiles` shows the week-long battery SoC profile for each building. Since we do not control the batteries, the profiles are at a constant value of 0.0 which is the initial SoC of the batteries.

`District-level KPIs`, `District-level simulation period load profiles`, and `District-level daily-average load profiles` are the district-level equivalent of `Building-level KPIs`, `Building-level simulation period load profiles`, and `Building-level daily-average load profiles`.

# Exercise 1: Simulate Random Controller

Time to try things out yourself! In this first exercise, you will run inference on a random agent. CityLearn has an implementation of a control agent that predicts random actions (`citylearn.agents.base.Agent`) and it has been imported earlier with the alias `RandomAgent`.

The next experiment utilizes a simple rule-based control (RBC) agent. RBC is a popular control strategy that is used in most systems e.g. HVAC, batteries, etc because of their level of simplicity. They are  best described as a set of rules expressed as if-else statements and conditions that guide their decision making. An example of such statement is `if outdoor dry-bulb temperature is 20 degrees Celcius and hour 10 PM, charge battery with 5% of capacity`. Now the actual implementation of this statement is open-ended as a designer can choose to program it using any programming language e.g. Python (as used in CityLearn) or a proprietary language that the battery manufacturer uses. Nevertheless, at a high-level, it simplifies to a set of statements and conditions that are easily understood and mappable (think decision tree in supervised learning).

The RBC we will be designing here, is a set of if-else statements that use the `hour` observation to determine the amount of energy to charge or discharge a battery. Remember we are using a centralized single-agent control strategy thus, the if-else statements we define will apply to all batteries in all buildings.

We will make use of the CityLearn [HourRBC](https://www.citylearn.net/api/citylearn.agents.rbc.html#citylearn.agents.rbc.HourRBC) agent implementation. The `citylearn.agents.rbc.HourRBC` class allows one to define a custom `action_map` using the `hour` as the `if-else` condition and the battery capacity proportion as the `action` where negative proportions imply discharging and positive proportions imply charging.

In this example below, we will use the first half of the day to charge the battery to capacity and the remaining half to discharge at a constant rate. This is by no means an ideal strategy however, in the next exercise, you will be able to fine-tune this action mapping to something more suitable.

## Solution

The solution below, begins charging from 8 AM till 4 PM. It charges at a highest rate between 1 PM and 3 PM when there is excess net export.

Discharging occurs between 6 PM and midnight with meximum discharge of 40% of the battery's capacity being discharged during the peak hours of 7-8 PM.

# Experiment 3: An Introduction to Tabular Q-Learning Algorithm as an Adaptive Controller
---

Tuning your RBC must have revealed that it can be a cumbersome and labor intensive process, especially as the number of buildings, time period and variance in load profiles increase. What will be ideal is an adaptive controller that can adjust to different occupant preferences and behaviors in each building that influence load profiles and adjust to different weather conditions that affect the seasonal variance in load profiles.

Moreover, we want a controller that is able to learn with little to no knowledge about the environment model it is controlling unlike the RBC tuning process where you probably chose your charge and discharge proportion by visually inspecting the building load profiles. Instead, we want a controller that can learn those patterns in a data-driven fashion.

## Q-Learning Background
[Tabular Q-Learning](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00992698) is a popular model-free reinforcement learning technique due to its simplicity. In simple tasks with small finite state sets, and discrete actions, all transitions can be represented using a table, hence the name Tabular Q-Learning, which stores the state-action values, i.e., Q-values.

After taking an action $a$, given a state $s$, and observing the immediate reward $r$ for taking $a$ at $s$, learning is achieved through updating $Q(s, a)$ ([Bellman equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bellman_equation)) as:

$$
Q(s, a) = Q(s, a) + \alpha [r + \gamma \max_{a'} Q(s', a') - Q(s, a)]
$$

where $Q(s, a)$ is the Q-value for taking action $a$ in state $s$, $\alpha ∈ [0, 1]$ is the learning rate, which explicitly defines to what degree new knowledge overrides old knowledge: for $\alpha = 0$, no learning happens, while for $\alpha = 1$, all prior knowledge is lost. $\gamma$ is the discount factor which allows the algorithm balance between an agent that considers only immediate rewards ($\gamma$ = 0) and one that strives towards long term rewards ($\gamma$ = 1). $\max_{a'} Q(s', a')$ is the maximum Q-value for all actions $a'$ in the next state $s'$ that is reached after taking action $a$ at state $s$.

In other words, the optimal policy, $\pi$, results from taking those actions $a$ that maximize the respective Q-values in each state, $s$. In order for the algorithm to converge to the optimal policy, the requirement is that each state-action pair $(s, a)$ be experienced many times, such that the Q-values converge.

### Algorithm

The general Q-Learning algorithm is as follows:

> 1. Initialize the Q-table for all state-action pairs.
> 2. Set the learning rate $\alpha$ ($0 < \alpha < 1$) and the discount factor $\gamma$ ($0 < \gamma < 1$).
> 3. Repeat the following steps for each episode:
>     - Observe the initial state $s$.
>     - Choose an action $a$ based on the epsilon-greedy policy (a random action is chosen with probability epsilon, $\epsilon$ and the action with the highest Q-value is chosen with probability $1 - \epsilon$).
>     - Take the action $a$ and observe the next state $s'$ and the reward $r$.
>     - Update the Q-value of the state-action pair $(s,a)$ using the Bellman equation.
>     - Set $s = s'$.
> 4. Repeat step 3 for a large number of episodes or until convergence is reached.

### Action Selection

In Q-learning, the process of accumulating knowledge happens through the trade-off between exploiting known, high-reward, actions, and exploring other, unknown, actions that have not been executed yet under that state. The $\epsilon$-greedy approach which we use here, selects a random action with probability epsilon, $\epsilon$ (exploration), and the action with the highest expected return with probability $1 - \epsilon$ (exploitation). This balancing allows the agent to avoid local minima (exploration), while striving towards convergence (exploitation). In practice, $\epsilon$ is set relatively large in the beginning of the learning process, and then reduced progressively. The choice of the initial value and the reduction strategy is domain specific and a task of the designer.

## CityLearn Tabular Q-Learning Implementation

CityLearn has a Tabular Q-learning implementation in its `citylearn.agents.q_learning.TabularQLearning` class (see [docs](https://www.citylearn.net/api/citylearn.agents.base.html#citylearn.agents.q_learning.TabularQLearning)). This Q-Learning implementation is inspired by the [BOPTEST Tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WeA_3PQeySba0MMRRte_oZTF7ptlP_Ra#scrollTo=9U81QUVcUfoW&line=17&uniqifier=1) but follows the general algorithm in the literature that we have described. However, a caveat of making use of this agent is that it requires discrete observations and actions in order to update the Q-Table whereas the default CityLearn environment provides continuous observations and actions.

CityLearn provides an environment wrapper, `TabularQLearningWrapper` (see [docs](https://www.citylearn.net/api/citylearn.wrappers.html#citylearn.wrappers.DiscreteSpaceWrapper)) used to discretize observations and actions before passing to an agent. All we need to do is define the number of bins to use to discretize the observations and actions using the wrapper's `observation_bin_sizes` and `action_bin_sizes` initialization variables.

We begin by initializing a new environment:
"""

tql_env = CityLearnEnv(
    DATASET_NAME,
    central_agent=CENTRAL_AGENT,
    buildings=BUILDINGS,
    active_observations=ACTIVE_OBSERVATIONS,

    simulation_end_time_step=SIMULATION_END_TIME_STEP,
)

"""We will discretize the hour into 24 bins and the action into 12 bins. Hour is an observation shared by all buildings thus, its values are the same in all buildings at each time step. For this reason, one of the dimensions of our Q-Table will equal the hour bin count. The action space for controlling the batteries has the same size as the number of buildings thus when discretized, the other Q-Table dimension will equal the `electrical_storage` action raised to the power of building count:"""

for b in tql_env.buildings:
    # add a bin size definition for the buildings
    observation_bin_sizes.append(observation_bins)
    action_bin_sizes.append(action_bins)

The net electricity consumption profile as a result of the Q-Learning agent shows unstable and spiky consumption. The reason for this behavior is seen in the battery SoC curves where the changes in SoC are abrupt. This highlights an issue with our discretized action space having too large steps as trade off for maintaining a reasonably-sized Q-Table.

## Replacing the Q-Table with a Function Approximator

Tabular Q-Learning is affected by the curse of dimensionality: as the size of the state space increases due to, e.g., continuous sensor inputs, the size of the Q-table has to necessarily increase is well. In particular for building control, the curse of dimensionality is significant, considering the potentially large number of sensors measuring various quantities (temperature, humidity, energy consumption, etc.) continuously. This means that the agent has an exponentially increasing number of state-action pairs to explore before it can converge to an optimal solution. Function approximators, e.g., linear regression or artificial neural networks ([Haykin (2009)](https://www.pearson.com/en-us/subject-catalog/p/neural-networks-and-learning-machines/P200000003278/9780133002553)), have been proposed as solutions that allow generalization by directly mapping the state-action pairs, $(s, a)$, to their respective Q-value, $Q(s, a)$. Refer to [Reinforcement learning for intelligent environments](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781315142074-37/reinforcement-learning-intelligent-environments-zoltan-nagy-june-young-park-josé-ramón-vázquez-canteli) for more information on how to make use of function approximators to improve learning in reinforcement learning control (RLC).

In the next section, we will introduce the soft-actor critic (SAC) algorithm, which is a model-free Q-Learning algorithm, that uses a neural network to approximate the Q-values thus, reducing the cost of training compared to Tabular Q-Learning.

# Experiment 4: Optimize a Soft-Actor Critic Reinforcement Learning Controller
---

To control an environment like CityLearn that has continuous states and actions, tabular Q-learning is not practical, as it suffers from the _curse of dimensionality_. Actor-critic reinforcement learning (RL) methods use artificial neural networks to generalize across the state-action space. The actor network maps the current states to the actions that it estimates to be optimal. Then, the critic network evaluates those actions by mapping them, together with the states under which they were taken, to the Q-values.

Soft actor-critic (SAC) is a model-free off-policy RL algorithm. As an off-policy method, SAC can reuse experience and learn from fewer samples. SAC is based on three key elements: an actor-critic architecture, off-policy updates, and entropy maximization for efficient exploration and stable training. SAC learns three different functions: the actor (policy), the critic (soft Q-function), and the value function.

This tutorial does not discuss the theory and algorithm of SAC but for interested participants please, refer to [Soft Actor-Critic Algorithms and Applications](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.1812.05905).

We will now initialize a new environment and plug it to an SAC agent to help us solve our control problem. Luckily, we do not have to write our own implementation of the SAC algorithm. Instead, we can make use of Python libraries that have standardized the implementation of a number of RL algorithms. One of such libraries that we will use is [Stable Baselines3](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/index.html). At the time of writing, there are [13 different RL algorithms](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/guide/algos.html#rl-algorithms) implemented between Stable Baselines3 and Stable-Baselines3 - Contrib (contrib package for Stable-Baselines3 - experimental reinforcement learning code), including SAC.

The new environment is initialized below:
"""

sac_env = CityLearnEnv(
    DATASET_NAME,
    central_agent=CENTRAL_AGENT,
    buildings=BUILDINGS,
    active_observations=ACTIVE_OBSERVATIONS,
    simulation_start_time_step=SIMULATION_START_TIME_STEP,
    simulation_end_time_step=SIMULATION_END_TIME_STEP,
)

"""Before our environment is ready for use in Stable Baselines3, we need to take a couple of preprocessing steps in the form of wrappers. Firstly, we will wrap the environment using the `NormalizedObservationWrapper` (see [docs](https://www.citylearn.net/api/citylearn.wrappers.html#citylearn.wrappers.NormalizedObservationWrapper)) that ensure all observations that are served to the agent are [min-max normalized](https://www.codecademy.com/article/normalization) between [0, 1] and cyclical observations e.g. hour, are encoded using the [sine and cosine transformation](https://www.avanwyk.com/encoding-cyclical-features-for-deep-learning/)."""

sac_env = NormalizedObservationWrapper(sac_env)

"""Next, we wrap with the `StableBaselines3Wrapper` (see [docs](https://www.citylearn.net/api/citylearn.wrappers.html#citylearn.wrappers.StableBaselines3Wrapper)) that ensures observations, actions and rewards are served in manner that is compatible with Stable Baselines3 interface:"""

The SAC agent was calling for discharge all the time! To give it away, the reason for this behavior is the reward function that we have used to train the agent 😅.

Recall that the Bellman equation uses a reward, $r$, to update the Q-values hence the Q-Table is sensitive to the way the $r$ changes for $(s, a, s')$ tuple. That is to say, we need to make sure the reward we calculate after an action, $a$, is taken at state, $s$, quantifies how-well that action actually causes desirable next state, $s'$. If we define a poor reward function, we risk not learning quickly, or undesirable outcomes. See this example of the [implication of a poorly designed reward function](https://openai.com/research/faulty-reward-functions) where an agent learns to maximize a game score but with dangerous actions!

The reward function is a variable in the CityLearn environment. The [docs](https://www.citylearn.net/api/citylearn.reward_function.html) provides information on in-built reward functions that can be used in simulation. The reward function used at run time is that which is defined in the dataset schema and used to construct the environment. It can be overridden by parsing an alternative reward function that inherits from the `citylearn.reward_function.RewardFunction` class (see [docs](https://www.citylearn.net/api/citylearn.reward_function.html#citylearn.reward_function.RewardFunction)). Let us see what the current reward is:
"""

help(sac_env.unwrapped.reward_function)

"""The current reward functions is the electricity consumption from the grid at the current time step returned as a negative value. While this reward will penalize high electricity consumption, it might not be ideal for all KPIs we are trying to optimize. As you would imagine, the best way to minimize electricity consumption is to try to move all loads to the battery hence, the insistence of the agent to continue to discharge the batteries!

## Defining a Custom Reward Function

We want to reduce electricity cost and emissions. Likewise, we want to reduce the peaks and ramping, and increase the load factor. One way to achieve this is to teach the agent to charge the batteries when electricity is cheap after 9 PM and before 4 PM, which typically coincides with when the grid is cleaner (lower emissions). But recall that each building is able to generate power provided there is solar radiation. So, we can take advantage of self-generation in the late morning to late afternoon to charge for free and discharge the rest of the day thus, reducing electricity cost and emissions at the very least. Also, by shifting the early morning and evening peak loads to the batteries we can improve on our peak and load-factor KPIs.

We should also teach our agent to ensure that renewable solar generation is not wasted by making use of the PV to charge the batteries while they are charged below capacity. On the flip side, the agent should learn to discharge when there is net positive grid load and the batteries still have stored energy.

Given these learning objectives, we can now define a reward function that closely satisfies the criteria for which the agent will learn good rewards:

$$
    r = \sum_{i=0}^n \Big(p_i \times |C_i|\Big)
$$

$$
    p_i = -\left(1 + \textrm{sign}(C_i) \times \textrm{SoC}^{\textrm{battery}}_i\right)
$$

The reward function, $r$, is designed to minimize electricity cost, $C$. It is calculated for each building, $i$ and summed to provide the agent with a reward that is representative of all $n$ buildings. It encourages net-zero energy use by penalizing grid load satisfaction when there is energy in the battery as well as penalizing net export when the battery is not fully charged through the penalty term, $p$. There is neither penalty nor reward when the battery is fully charged during net export to the grid. Whereas, when the battery is charged to capacity and there is net import from the grid the penalty is maximized.

Now we define this custom reward using the instructions provided in the [docs](https://www.citylearn.net/overview/reward_function.html#how-to-define-a-custom-reward-function) below and set it as the reward for the SAC agent.

# Exercise 3: Tune your SAC Agent
---

Thus far, you have 1) established a baseline energy performance for your buildings without the energy flexibility provided by batteries 2) made a case for following some logic over random actions to control batteries, 3) tuned your own rule-based control (RBC) agent, 4) trained a Tabular Q-Learning agent, 3) implemented the soft-actor critic (SAC) off-policy reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm with a crude reward function and a better tailored reward function.

When each control agent is evaluated on the set of building-level and district-level KPIs, we find that if carefully tuned, your RBC will improve the baseline albeit a painstaking effort. The Tabular Q-Learning agent has the potential to adapt to unique building properties but suffers from the curse of dimensionality affecting its convergence to an optimal solution for the battery management. We also find that the SAC agent is sensitive to the reward function design and with a custom reward that is tailored towards achieving our evaluation KPIs, we can achieve a performance that is better than the baseline case and potentially better than an averagely tuned RBC.

However, we find that the SAC + custom reward case did not converge after our training episodes. Also, the improvements it provides beyond the baseline are not very large. Hence, there is still room for improvement.

In the next cells, you will improve the SAC model by taking on or more of the following actions:
1. Expand upon the observation space beyond using just the `hour`. Refer to the [CityLearn Observation docs](https://www.citylearn.net/overview/observations.html) to discover other available environment observations.
2. Optimize the SAC hyperparameters. In our previous models, we used the default Stable Baselines3 hyperparameters. Hyperparameter tuning is an _art_ of its own. Refer to the [Stable Baselines3 SAC docs](https://stable-baselines3.readthedocs.io/en/master/modules/sac.html#stable_baselines3.sac.SAC) to learn about the SAC hyperparameters. Also, refer to [Training with Soft-Actor Critic](https://github.com/yosider/ml-agents-1/blob/master/docs/Training-SAC.md#training-with-soft-actor-critic) for a more elaborate description of what the hyperparameters mean, their typical values and appropriate values for different case scenarios.
3. Increase the number of training episodes.
4. Update the reward function with a function you deem more appropriate towards optimizing the KPIs. Perhaps, you can design a reward function that targets a specific KPI. You can also keep the current custom reward function.

First, we shall define a function that performs all the procedures that led up to us training the SAC agent and reporting it's results:

## Solution

In this example solution, only the active observations have been updated to include `day_type` i.e. day-of-week, `solar_generation`, `net_electricity_consumption`, and `electrical_storage_soc`, in addition to the `hour`. The default hyperparameters are kept and the agent is trained using the previously defined reward function and episodes.

This updated setup further reduces both building-level KPIs and reduces the average daily peak district KPI.

"""# Next Steps
---

Now that you are a _CityLearner_, here are some next steps and ideas (asides the awesome ideas you probably already have of course 😉):

## Other Ideas

- Rerun the entire tutorial with a new `RANDOM_SEED`, `BUILDING_COUNT`, `DAY_COUNT` and/or `ACTIVE_OBSERVATIONS`. Remember to for Tabular Q-Learning if you use other observations in your simulations.
- How does the Tabular Q-Learning agent perform with a different set of hyperparameters and/or active observations?
- How well does the Tabular Q-Learning learn if we use the custom reward function we defined? Are there any improvements compared to the original reward function?
- Try to train the SAC agent on all the buildings and the full one-year period in the `citylearn_challenge_2022_phase_all` dataset.
- Can you still improve some KPIs without self-generation in the buildings i.e. no photovoltaic (PV) system? To disable self-generation, initialize your environment with `solar_generation=False`.
- In our hand-on experiments here, we trained and tested on the same days. In reality, when an RL agent is deployed, it may experience states and state transitions that were not seen during training. Try to evaluate your trained agent on a different week and see if your trained agent generalizes well.
- Try out the other datasets in CityLearn.
- Make a submission to previous and any current [The CityLearn Challenge editions](https://www.citylearn.net/citylearn_challenge/index.html).
- Bring your own dataset to CityLearn!
- \<Insert __YOUR__ ideas 🙂\>
